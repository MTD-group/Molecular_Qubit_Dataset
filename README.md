# Molecular_Qubit_Dataset 
Molecular qubit relaxation time data set contain the names, compsition, and expeirmental relaxation times from literature. Additional information about the geometry of the molecules, computed from experimental strucure files, is also included. Cif files are numbers by the ID number given in the relaxation time CSV file.

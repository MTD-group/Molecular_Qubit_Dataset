# Molecular_Qubit_Dataset 
Molecular qubit relaxation time data set contains the names, composition, and experimental relaxation times from literature. Additional information about the geometry of the molecules, computed from experimental structure files, is also included. CIF files are numbers by the ID number given in the relaxation time CSV file.
